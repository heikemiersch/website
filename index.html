            <p>
                From September 2019 to February 2020 I have taken part in an intensive full-time coding programme
                (on-site, five months, 800 hours)
                for full-stack web development. Simulating a real working environment operating agile, the programme was
                a 100% project-based, using a learning-by-doing methodology focussing on JavaScript, Vue.js, Vue CLI,
                REST API, Java 8 and SpringBoot.

                        <p>
                            I studied history, archaeology and English literature and worked for exhibitions,
                            museums and in tourism, writing, designing, managing and organising.
                            I chose all my activities, side jobs and hobbies in such a way, that I could pursue my
                            three passions: Bringing order to chaos, achieving the best possible success with as little
                            effort as possible, and at the end of the process, having created something
                            that was not there before, but can be reused and continued.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After more than ten years in the same job, I had worked on everything that I could work on:
                            guiding tours in German and English,
                            designing and running educational seminars, research and archives, tours coordination in the
                            office, staff planning, a little bookkeeping, selling tickets and advising visitors.
                            But first, there were no new development opportunities within the scope of my
                            activities. Second, I had to admit to myself that my heart was no longer in what
                            I had once studied.
                            I wanted a change, even though I didn't know what it should look like at first. I had been
                            watching
                            the tech scene for quite a while and had developed an initial interest in rockets, robots
                            and data. After some research into the different areas of classic
                            tech companies, I read about UX, UI, front-end, back-end, full-stack, database development,
                            as
                            well as
                            business management. The more I read and learned, the more specific my desire became: I
                            wanted
                            to
                            learn programming. In August 2019, I quit my permanent job.
                        </p>
                        <p> So the first step was the coding academy, where I worked on projects in an agile environment
                            that simulated the real working world. I acquired basic skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and
                            Java
                            and worked on websites, mobile web apps and a multiplayer game.
                            I filled the time of the pandemic, which followed seamlessly after my training graduation,
                            with
                            some months in Spain and England as well as playing codewars and taking more online courses.
                            But as nothing can replace working on real projects with real deadlines, I am looking for a
                            team,
                            where I can apply and deepen my knowledge. I would like to venture into areas
                            that I am not even aware of now. Not only to satisfy my own curiosity, but also to actually
                            create something, that helps to shape the future.
